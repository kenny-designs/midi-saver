# midi-saver
## A web app for exporting midi files as a .wav in the soundfont of your choice

This tool was originally created as a way to convert midi files into a a variety of instruments for use in my Mozart Dice Game
application. I've found it rather useful and I'd like to make it available for anyone to use and adapt for their own needs.

The program currently lacks so I'll be making a few more improvements before moving back to my main projects.
